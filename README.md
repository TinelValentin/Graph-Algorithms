# Graph Algorithms
 A set of graph algorithms implemented for the course "Algoritmica grafurilor" in java, using java swing for the UI.

1.Graph

An interface that allows the user to create a directed or an undirected graph.

2.RandomGeneratedGraph

An interface that draws a random graph with the number of nodes given by the user.

3.Labyrinth

An interface that draws a labyrinth from an adjacency matrix and finds the path to the exits using a BFS.

4.TopologicalSort

An interface that allows the user to draw a directed or an undirected graph and has the option to calculate the topological sort and show it in the console.

5.ConnectedComponents

An interface that allows the user to draw a directed or an undirected graph and calculate the connected components or strongly connected components and draw them.

6.PrimKruskalBoruvka

An interface that implements those algorithms on the given graph.

7.Luxembourg

Given the xml of Luxembourg, it draws the map and allows the user to select any 2 nodes and calculate the shorthest path using djikstra.

8.FordFulkerson

An interface that implements the maximum flow algorithm on a graph made from the interface.
